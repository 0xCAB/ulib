#Comparisons Among Several Hashing Implementations

= Introduction =

We will do some performance comparison. These including aligned hashing and several other popular implementations.  Of major concern is the duration for each find() and insert() operations.

= Experiment Results =

The tests are performed on a Linux 64-bit machine, with Intel Xeon E5620  @2.40GHz
Processor and 64G memory. The test program was compiled using GCC 3.4.5.
