==How to Build This Library==
Use 'make' to build the entire library. After that you will have the
headers reside under the include/ and static libraries under the
lib/. Alternatively, you can also perform 'make release' to strip the
debugging information.

To compile the library with other compilers, for example, Intel C++ compiler, you can do "make CC=icc CXX=icpc AR=xiar".
