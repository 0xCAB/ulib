*Compiling the ULIB:*

Use 'make' to build the library. Alternatively, you can use 'make
release' to build the library as well as to strip the debug information.

It is recommended to perform a 'make test' once you have compiled the
library. This will start various self-tests.

----
*Known Issues:*

It is known that certain GCCs generate buggy code, incurring
segmentation faults in hash_chain. If you have any of the hash_chain
tests failed because of segmentation fault. Please apply the
gcc_hash_chain.patch patch, which is located under patch/:
{{{
  cd ulib_src_path/
  patch -p0 -i patch/gcc_hash_chain.patch
}}}
