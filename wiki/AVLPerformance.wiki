== AVL Performance Comparison ==

We compare the performance of several popular AVL tree implementations: GNU libavl, OpenSolaris Kernel AVL, and the one in ulib.

First, we fed each AVL tree with 64bit random numbers during which the insert speed was measured, as shown in the following figure.

Next, we performed massive random searches on those AVL trees and the search speed was measured. The following figure depicts the search performance for various tree sizes.
