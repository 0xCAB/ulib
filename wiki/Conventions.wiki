=Conventions=
In this wiki, we introduce the conventions for programming with ULIB.

===Return Value Specification===
Unless it is explicitly stated, the following conventions hold for return value. (NOTE: the return value in question means the status code for the function call, so don't mess with the output of the function.)
  * For int type return value, a function returns -1 for an error, 0 otherwise.
  * For pointer type return value, a function returns NULL/0 for an error, non-zero otherwise.
